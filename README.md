Learning Nestjs, Postgresql, Prisma and docker. Trying to build out a more robust backend than previous ones I've done so far. 

So far I've implemented:

-login/signup
-basic auth. w/ argon2 hashing for passwords
-jwt
-basic db structure (to be expanded)

Yet to be learn and implement:
Other ways of auth. (Oauth/Oauth2)
Implementing a live chat (socket.io) for clients/professionals to interact with each other.
File uploading for users to have pfps and works related stuff.
Learning at least, e2e testing and use it here.
